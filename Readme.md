A/B Test Analysis – Vanguard Digital Interface

Week 5–6 Ironhack Data Analytics Project



⸻

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes an A/B experiment run by Vanguard to evaluate whether a redesigned digital interface improves user experience and completion behavior.

The dataset contains step-level logs for thousands of visits, including:
	•	Process steps
	•	Error flags
	•	Time spent per step
	•	Completion status
	•	Variation assignment (Control vs Test)

Goal: Determine whether the Test group performs significantly better than the Control group.
